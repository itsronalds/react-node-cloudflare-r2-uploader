# React Node Cloudflare R2 Uploader

A full-stack template for uploading files from a React app to Cloudflare R2 storage using a secure Node.js backend and presigned URLs.

---

## Features

- **React Frontend:** User-friendly interface for selecting and uploading files.
- **Node.js Backend:** REST API to generate and manage presigned URLs for secure file uploads.
- **Cloudflare R2 Integration:** Store files reliably in the cloud.
- **Security:** Credentials are never exposed to the client; presigned URLs expire after a set time.

   AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<your_access_key>
   AWS_SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

## Usage

1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
2. Select a file and click "Upload".
3. The file will be uploaded to your Cloudflare R2 bucket using a temporary presigned URL.

## Security Notes

- Never expose your Cloudflare credentials in frontend code.
- Presigned URLs expire for added security.
- Limit API key permissions to only what's needed.
